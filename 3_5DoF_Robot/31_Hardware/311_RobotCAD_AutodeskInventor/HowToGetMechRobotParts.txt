In this project, we used the TinkerCAD Braccio robot from Arduino.
CAD is not absolutely necessary. 
In our case, the robot's CAD was used to position the markers correctly and measure the lengths and positions. 

You can download the CAD for the Arduino robot directly:

We used the CAD from GeekThomad from the GrabCAD platform:

This CAD is much better structured and much easier to use. Take a look and see what you need and which you can use.
